# Lander Code

This project holds the code for the Lander Project completed as part of my engineering course. 

The "Arduino Code" gathers data from an Arduino, using accelerometer and environmental sensors. It then packages this data and transmits it.

The analysis code, is in the "Laptop Code" folder primarily in the "dataAnalysis.py" file retrieves data from a serial port, via a transceiver, performs calculations, stores the data using excel and pickle, as well as graphing the data.

The "Laptop Code" also performs interactive calibration checks with the Arduino, and can be connected in a variety of different ways.

This project was created to be part of a rocket launch and subsequent safe landing for my engineering course.

For more detail about the project, you can check the report PDF.
